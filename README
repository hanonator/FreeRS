You walk around the (f2p accessible) world of the runescape world, looking for supplies
to survive the wilderness.

- Day in the life of Mystic Flow
	- Skills, inventory, energy, ... everything is reset upon death
	- No banks, no shops, no help ... every man for himself
	- If you should disconnect, you have a 2 minute grace period to reconnect
	or you will lose all progress.
	- Logging out during combat will keep your character logged in, even
	if you are fighting AI.

- Energy
	- The food system is altered so that food no longer heals you but replenishes
	your energy.
	- If you are under 25% health, running will be disabled
	- If your energy reaches 0%, your health will slowly start to drain. Find food
	or fluids fast to replenish your energy or you will die.
	- The lower your energy, the less damage you will inflict. At 0% energy, your
	effective strength will be halved.
	- At 75% energy or above, your health will replenish itself so bandages are
	no longer needed.

- Bandages
	- Bandages are the only way to heal yourself if you are hurt. You get 5
	bandages when you spawn in and are dropped by zombies or found in crates
	near villages. 
	- Bandages heal 25% of your health.
	- You can use bandages on other players to heal them

- Skills
	- Skills are based on their runescape equivalent with minor changes
	to boost/nerf some aspects if necessary such as multiple ores from
	rocks
	
- Tools
	- No starting tools
	- Tools found as drops from monsters or crates. some tools are spawned
	on predefined locations

- Loot
	- All AI will have the same basic drop table consisting of bandages,
	food, munition, runes, bronze weaponry, etc. and a different table
	specific to the type of monster
	- The first drop table is all an uncommon drop whereas the monster-specific
	table's rarity depends on the monster being killed
	- All loot is global, so you can steal other player's loot as soon as the
	monster is downed.

- Experience
	- All non-combat skill experience is dealt as its runescape equivalent
	- Combat experience is earned upon kill. Full experience is given to the
	players who have attacked the monster and is still close by.


- PvP
	- Enabled throughout the whole world.
	- There is a 2 minute spawn protection for people who have just spawned into
	the game or who have respawned due to dying.
	- Spawn protection also makes sure the zombies do not attack.
	- Spawn protection removed when player engages in combat

- Monsters
	- Zombies are more frequently found near a city and will have a lower combat
	level depending on how far away they are from cities.
	- Zombies rarely drop items to motivate the player to explore the map

- Buddy system
	- Buddy system allows you to teleport to players in your friends list if the targeted
	player accepts your teleport request.

- Combat
- A lot of changes to combat to make the game more fair, and it shouldn't
matter as this isn't a runescape emulation but rather a game mod using
the runescape engine
	- Magic delays on spells to counteract "combos"
	- Energy affects maximum hit
	- Range will be buffed
	- Cannot engage in unarmed combat
	- There is no arrow dropping
	- Some special attacks will be altered/buffed

- Player channels
	- Commands have been replaced by player channels
	- Player is automatically assigned to the default channel
	- ::create #channel_name
	- ::leave #channel_name
	- ::join #channel_name
	- ::ignore #player_name
	- ::unignore #player_name
